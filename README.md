## Getting Started

You can clone repository using git:

`git clone https://github.com/kryvytskyidenys/lia`

You can add lia as static library to your project using cmake.

Also there is tests.cpp files with simple operations to see usage examples.

## Features

- Linear algebra: 
  + n-dimensional vectors
  + 4x4-dimensional matrices
  + transformations (translations, rotation, scale)
  + utility (matrix transposition, inversion)
  + orthographic and perpective projections matrices
- Trigonemetry
  + radian/degree conversions.
